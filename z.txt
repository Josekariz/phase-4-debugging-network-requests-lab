500 -internat server error meant that there was  a typo in there or an error
    To fix this i went into the controller and checked for typos and found that toy was being called as Toys.update


404- means that the route was not found

  To fix this i went into the config > routes and added a new destroy route in the resources

Unexcpected  end of json means that there is no json data being taken from the backend but there is some json data being displayed at the frontend

  I went into the controllers and I rendered some json data of status ok when the thing was updated.
